The intro to a jumpchain or CYOA or other SI is a brutal make or break moment. Such a short amount of time to motivate readers, convince them that this fic is good, actually. Worse than the 'locker scene' that plagued Worm fanfiction for so long, because not only is it heavily constrained and formulaic, but you also have to get across the underlying mechanics of the thing. And, of course, I'm thinking about all of this because one minute I was at my desk at my office job, and the next I was floating in some kind of white void.

Just as I'm thinking that I hope this is the setup to a jumpchain, and not something awful, a vague person shape appears in front of me, and speaks.

"That's close enough to consent for this. Okay. So. This is a Jumpchain. Or at least, something following a similar enough script. No, don't say anything yet, don't even think anything yet, let me explain first. You are getting the chance to save a multiverse. Comic book like superheroes and supervillains, multiverse in the balance, the whole nine yards. Now my little munchkin, the limits: I can't tell you all of the limits. What I will say is that I can only send in a single person, we have a budget to work on for empowering you, and while I am placing my thumb as firmly on the scale as I can, Free Will is a pretty big deal for us."

For just a moment the shadowy shape became distinct, and 'jump-chan' looked like... an older me, with a night sky filled with stars instead of eyes...

"Naughty naughty, I *said* no thinking yet."

I could hear the smirk.

"So, my thumb on the scale, what kind of power disbursement system do you think will work for you here? We are working on a time limit. No, before you think - no yogjumper. No Medaka Box. No god-mode-ing. I say no god-mode-ing and your mind immediately jumps to the Mahabharata. There isn't even a published Mahabharata jumpdoc! Come on, out with it."

I lick my lips, before saying: "Fast five, with double or nothing, no companions...?"

"Eh, good enough. Right, oh, yeah, and there are fundamental underlying mechanics to this omniverse, so use your judgement. Some jumpdocs, or some perks within jumpdocs might just give you less than you think."

"Uh, can you give me some guidance when I pick a jumpdoc like that - surely that wouldn't contravene Free Will if I'm asking for such a narrow thing?"

And, well, after that was just a lot of tedious cross referencing things in jumpdocs, with the occasional "Hmm. No. That won't work out how you are thinking." from my benefactor.

"Ah, so, before I pick between these builds, which comic book universe are you putting me in?"

"I can't tell you that until you have picked out a build. Oh, and a name - I'm taking your current one for... safe keeping. Just think of it like... having to stay in character."

"Uh, I guess I'll go by Flavius Belisarius. Uh, and for a hero name I'll have to wait and see which multiverse I end up in - wouldn't want to be a duplicate, right? For my build, given the options, I'll take this:"

"The Pact is sealed. The universe I will be sending you to is Wildbow's Worm, right at the start of canon. Come on, don't make that face: for all the horrors of that setting, you don't have to worry about bullshit like Flashpoint. Anyway, you have all of your powers and abilities, all of your 'stuff' is in your warehouse, it should all be pretty straightforward. I'll give you a second to activate whatever you need to activate, then I'm sending you on."

As my mind expanded under all of the mental enhancement perks I had, I fumbled around and activated 'Unbeholden', and while I was still trying to activate my power ring, there was a surprisingly non-jarring transition.
